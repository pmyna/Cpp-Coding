For a weather study, the temperature is measured five times every day for 3 weeks. 
The result of the measurement is stored in a 3 dimensional array double[5][7][3]. 
Write a function that receives this array as a parameter and determines and outputs the average temperatures for the individual days, the weeks and overall.
