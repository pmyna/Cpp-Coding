A fanatical CD collector friend of mine has asked you to write him a simple program to manage his collection. 
He wants the following functions: For each album artist, name and style should be storable. 
Input, change and deletion of entries should be possible. 
A search should be possible either by artist, by album name or by style and should provide a list of all matching CDs.
